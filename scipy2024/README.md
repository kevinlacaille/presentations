# Urban EcoVision: Climate Mitigation with Drones and Python

## Preparing your Workspace 

Follow the set up instructions below to run the Jupyter Notebooks for this workshop.

### Option 1: (recommended) Run in Google Colab

Interact directly with this repo's Jupyter Notebooks by running them in Google Colab.

Each Notebook will have its own **"Open in Colab"** button: once running on Colab, you'll need to run a quick setup cell in each notebook (this will install prerequisites and download data into your Colab workspace). You can also choose to make a copy of the Notebook in your own Google Drive, if you want to save any changes you make (not required for this workshop).

### Option 2: Run local Jupyter instance

You can instead choose to open this Notebook in your own local Jupyter instance. In that case, you'll need to clone this repository and install/download prerequisites.

Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:kevinlacaille/presentations.git
cd scipy2024/
```

**Prerequisites**
- Read the [installation.md](installation.md) for instructions of how to set up the (optional) virtual environment.
- Install all libraries `pip install -r requirements.txt`
